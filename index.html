	<h1>Welcome to Guillermo's personal space on the web</h1>
	<p>This site is intended to share my exploration of research topics that interest me.</p>
	<p>The posts follow a summary format, ideally with standardized sections. These notes are very personal and therefore reflect the works in a way that best fits my understanding while condensing the information. The notes are not necessarily tutorials or alternative, intuitive ways to understand the topics, but I hope they are helpful to others.

I also hope this space helps me connect with others who share similar research interests and engage in discussions on these topicsâ€”whether for better understanding or to propose new ideas. If you are interested in discussing these topics, feel free to send me an email.</p>
