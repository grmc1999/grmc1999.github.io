This site is intended to share my exploration of research topics that interest me.

The posts follow a summary format, ideally with standardized sections. These notes are very personal and therefore reflect the works in a way that best fits my understanding while condensing the information. The notes are not necessarily tutorials or alternative, intuitive ways to understand the topics, but I hope they are helpful to others. I also hope this space helps me connect with others who share similar research interests and engage in discussions on these topicsâ€”whether for better understanding or to propose new ideas. If you are interested in discussing these topics, feel free to send me an email.
